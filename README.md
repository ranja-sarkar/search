# Evolution of how protein structure is predicted 

[Robetta](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC441606/) is a tool that utilizes comparative modeling or *de novo* methods ([Rosetta](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/chapter/bookseries/abs/pii/S0076687904830040?via%3Dihub)) to predict the structure of a protein. It was back in 2004 when the Robetta web service was used. 

The [newest version](https://robetta.bakerlab.org/) of Robetta is using a deep learning method called [RoseTTAFold](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2021/07/rosettafold-accurate-protein-structure-prediction-accessible-to-all/), which arrived in [2021](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8754) just after DeepMind published the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2?fromPaywallRec=false) titled 'Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold'. Later in 2021 only, [AlphaFold2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8592092/) was published by the research group at Georgia Institute of Technology, USA. The open-soucrce code for AlphaFold2 is available [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold) and the high-level overview [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/inputs-and-outputs/a-high-level-overview/).

But before this in 2018 the paper titled ‘Computation protein design with deep learning neural networks’ was published. In this study, the neural network or deep learning approach was taken to computationally design a protein for predicting the probability of 20 natural amino acids on each residue in it. 

Around 2016-2017, I had tried to design full structure of human retinoblastoma (Rb) protein from parts using ROBETTA. The linker (RbPL) between two domains of the protein is highly dynamic and its structure was not known.
