# Evolution of protein structure predicture 

[Robetta](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/chapter/bookseries/abs/pii/S0076687904830040?via%3Dihub) is a tool that utilizes comparative modeling or de novo methods (Rosetta) to predict the structure of a protein.

Around 2016-2017, I had tried to design full structure of human retinoblastoma (Rb) protein from parts using ROBETTA. The linker (RbPL) between two domains of the protein is highly dynamic and its structure was not known.	
In 2018, the paper titled ‘Computation protein design with deep learning neural networks’ arrived. In this study, the neural network approach was taken to computationally design a protein for predicting the probability of 20 natural amino acids on each residue in it.
